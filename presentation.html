//Tell the story of why we created the app.
To help DJ's on the job. Someone would walk up in the middle of a party and request a song.

DJ has to go to youtube find song, download it and play it.

Usually it takes at least 3 websites total to have song ready to play.

With this website the DJ can get it all done in one page.



//Team efforts:

//We divided the project into 3 parts:
Pull Info from API - Daniel
Display and Download Songs - Jorge
Firebase - Travis
Front end - Everyone contributed

As time went by we all ended up merging each other's ideas and helped overcome challenges.



//Challenges
First challenge was to find a music API. This part drove our idea to a do or die situation.

Most music api's required authentication, a lot of options are discontinued, some you have to pay.

**Getting download button to save info to firebase

**Firebase, we had problems with displaying the snapshots. It would display more than it was added from the on click event.

**Music player had 3rd party restrictions.. Can't play a youtube video on your site.



//Improvement
**Login Page
**Play video on site - same page instead of opening a new window
**Sometimes the video doesn't play or download. It will bring wing video ID
**





//Try out different API and make decision based on: 
	*Information that we were able to retrieve
	*Free API
	*not authorization needed
	*good documentation
	*easy to follow and gather information

We had to have an API that provided:
Band Title
Song Title
Album
YouTube Video ID
